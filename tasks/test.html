    <p>In your initial consultation for dental implants, Dr. Lind will explain the procedure to you in full, and answer all of your questions. The next step will be to determine whether you are a good candidate for implants.</p>
    <p>We have access to state-of-the-art digital x-ray equipment that helps Dr. Lind measure the size and quality of the bone in your jaws and determine how and where the implants should be placed.</p>
    <p>If bone-grafting is needed, this will be scheduled as a separate surgery prior to placing the implants, but in many cases the implants can be put in your mouth in the next visit.</p>
    <h3>Placing the implants and restoration</h3>
    <p>The first step in the implant process is to extract the broken-down tooth if necessary and ensure that the place where the implants will go is ready to receive it.</p>
    <p>Implant surgery itself can be completed in less than an hour, after which your mouth will need time to heal. Depending on the quality of the bone tissue, Dr. Lind may be able to give you a temporary crown right away.</p>

        <p class="caption">Dental implants can restore your mouth to full health and function.</p>
    </section>
    <p>Once the implant or implants have been placed, Dr. Lind will see you periodically to check on how the bone is healing. It may be a few months before the permanent crown is placed, but once it is you will generally have a replacement tooth for life.</p>
    <p>In the case of implant-supported dentures, the process can often be completed more quickly because the chewing pressure is being more evenly distributed throughout your mouth.</p>
    <p class="bold">Smile with confidence!</p>
    <p>Dr. Lind has helped hundreds of patients reconstruct their smiles, but he is very aware that each case is unique. He will carefully design a treatment plan for you that is right for you and only you. With many options for treatment at his fingertips, he will make sure that you get the beautiful, healthy smile that you want.</p>

    <a name="candidates"></a>
    <h2>Are you a candidate for dental implants?</h2>
    <p>The ideal candidate for a dental implant is a person who is in good general and oral health. Adequate bone in your jaw is needed to support the implant. Some people who have lost bone in their jaw still can get implants. Usually the specialized bone grafting can be done with the implant placement, which reduces the number of surgical procedures.</p>
    <p>People who are currently wearing partial or full dentures can replace these with dental implants, or use implants to stabilize and secure the denture, making it much more comfortable.</p>
    <p>The types of people who are not good candidates for dental implants include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Young patients whose jawbones have not fully developed.</li>
        <li>Pregnant women</li>
        <li>People with certain existing medical conditions. If you can have routine dental treatment, you can generally have an implant placed. While precautions are advisable for certain conditions, patients with such chronic diseases as high blood pressure and diabetes are usually successful candidates for dental implant treatment.</li>
        <li>Patients who take certain medications such as steroids or drugs that suppress the immune system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In your initial examination, Dr. Lind can determine if you are a good candidate for dental implants, and explain all of your options to you. With his extensive training and experience, he has been able to help hundreds of people obtain healthy, beautiful smiles.</p>

    <h2>The advantages of Implant Dentistry</h2>
    <section style="width: 250px;" class="pull-right photo-right">

    <p>Dr. Lind's dental implants look and feel like natural teeth, and most importantly, they function like natural teeth. Dental implants are generally stronger and more durable than bridges and dentures and offer a permanent solution to tooth loss. Implants do not get cavities!</p>
    <p>If you have one or more missing teeth, one of the most important reasons to consider getting a replacement (such as an implant) is because the jawbone will wear away in the place where the tooth is missing.</p>
    <p>Over time this can create a sunken look, and cause a person to appear up to 10 or 15 years older than they actually are.</p>
    <p>Implants can also be used together with other dental procedures for greater effectiveness. For example, while a dental implant can be used to replace a single missing tooth, it can also be used to support a dental bridge or a set of upper or lower dentures. The use of implants to provide this kind of support will significantly improve your ability to bite down and chew normally.</p>
    <p>Dental implants are often considered to be the most functional and durable solution to replace missing teeth.</p>
